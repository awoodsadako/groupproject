        <p class="par">Eli’s Italian Ice is not just another regular frozen treat. We are a company with a mission, which is to serve our customers an affordable, yet uncompromising quality frozen eating experience! It is our goal to mesmerize your taste buds, while tickling your fancy as you enjoy the fun of flavor on a hot Summer afternoon. One of our overarching goals of giving back to the community through service and support, and we will also donate $1 of every purchase to a non-profit organization of choice for all corporate events.  
            Eli’s Italian Ice became the answer to a Grandmother’s love for her grandson, Elijah, who exhibited food allergies to ice cream at the tender age of two. Try telling a two-year-old that he cannot eat ice cream because it does not agree with him.  Exactly! It does not work. This effort lead to the search for a delectable and fun treat that kids, young and old, could enjoy time and time again without cause for worry about health issues. Of course, this treat had to also be one that did not leave Eli concerned about sticky fingers and washing his hands every 2 minutes! Fortunately, our journey was very short. Late in the Summer 0f 2018, while playing with freezing fruit on days too tired to look for non-dairy treats, Eli’s Ice was born.
         Starting with just four flavors that tasted and looked like fun, the journey began. Eli’s Ice now rotates between 16 flavors, including a flavor of the month, and fresh frozen fruit pieces!  Our treats are brought alive by the beautiful and natural flavors and colors of the fruit rainbow such as mango, pineapple, watermelon, cherry, and peach to name a few!  Our menu offers a great selection of both traditional and contemporary flavors.  We now operate 5 days a week, participate at neighborhood festivals, and cater to corporate events as well as private parties.  
        Eli’s Italian Ice is fun you can taste!  We are committed to making every visit enjoyable, and every treat delightful and memorable!  Frozen treats should be fun and tasty. Each experience should make you look forward to the next. Fun never tasted so good!
